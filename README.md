## Initial verification bridge
The first benchmark is the 15 m RC girder research bridge:
- 15.0 m span
- 11.0 m overall deck width
- 7.0 m carriageway
- 7 girders at 1.70 m spacing
- 950 mm precast girder depth
- 75 mm precast false slab + 175 mm in-situ slab = 250 mm physical deck depth
- 175 mm default composite compression-flange contribution unless false-slab participation is explicitly justified
- C35/45 concrete and B500 reinforcement baseline for the Eurocode case

The reference project is stored in `examples/reference_bridge_15m.py`.

The ANN is a surrogate for verified deterministic calculations; it is not the source of the bridge-design rules.

## ANN verification lock
Training-data export requires a `DeterministicSolverVerification` for the exact solver profile being used. A single Boolean cannot unlock ANN data. The manifest currently requires explicit verification of traffic loading, load combinations, flexure, shear, cracking, deflection, fatigue, detailing, transverse distribution and an independent benchmark; torsion is also required when it is in scope.

The simple-span Eurocode, continuous-span Eurocode and BS 5400 solver profiles are distinct. Verification of one profile cannot certify records generated by another. The continuous Eurocode profile remains locked until its complete deterministic verification programme, including an independent benchmark, is complete.

Eurocode rows preserve `fck_mpa`; BS 5400 rows preserve `fcu_mpa` rather than applying an implicit strength conversion.

If design shear exceeds concrete-only resistance, ANN export also requires the **actual provided shear reinforcement** so `g_V` is based on a real resistance rather than the quantity of reinforcement merely required by the design equation.

## Continuous-span verification boundary
The current continuous longitudinal solver has automated mechanics benchmarks for classical beam reactions/moments, influence-line response, support continuity, closed-form simply-supported deflection recovery and moving-load symmetry. These tests demonstrate internal numerical consistency but do **not** replace an independent bridge-software/grillage benchmark.

Continuous service deflection keeps span EI explicit. The solver does not silently choose gross, cracked, composite, creep-adjusted or construction-stage stiffness. Likewise, moving-train deflection is code-neutral until a specific traffic/service combination and validated transverse-distribution treatment are supplied upstream.

The current project-level continuous traffic workflow uses supplied validated/imported transverse lane distributions. It does not treat equal-share distribution as production ground truth, and it does not assume that moment distribution factors are automatically valid for deflection.

## MIDAS Civil / STAAD.Pro verification export
The verification exporter is designed to remove manual recreation of benchmark models. One internal longitudinal load case can generate:

```text
bridge_verification.mct
bridge_verification.std
bridge_verification_manifest.json
bridge_verification_expected_results.csv
```

The external line model carries support-line geometry, beam connectivity, stabilized boundary conditions, explicit material stiffness, section properties derived to reproduce the caller-supplied span EI, UDLs and point/axle loads at the same locations used internally. A moving axle train can also be frozen at an exact lead-axle position so structural response is compared without mixing differences in moving-load search algorithms.

The manifest stores model metadata and SHA-256 hashes. The expected-results table includes support reactions/rotations, member-end moments/shears, span moment/shear envelopes and deflection envelopes. External result tables can be normalized to the same schema and compared with explicit absolute and relative tolerances.

This exporter currently reproduces the **longitudinal line-model verification problem**. It does not yet claim to be a complete seven-girder/deck grillage exporter. Full grillage export will require validated transverse-member/deck stiffness, diaphragm modelling, bearing representation and load placement rules. MIDAS/STAAD text generation is based on their documented input syntax, but actual parser acceptance in installed MIDAS Civil and STAAD.Pro versions remains an external validation step.

## Installing research/ANN dependencies
The deterministic bridge solver remains lightweight. TensorFlow is an optional research dependency:

```bash
pip install -e '.[research]'
```

The core package and CI do not require TensorFlow just to perform deterministic bridge calculations.

## Engineering verification policy
No module should be treated as production-ready merely because it executes. Each code-specific equation, load model, partial factor, resistance model and serviceability check must be verified against the applicable standard, hand calculations and independent benchmark cases before its output is admitted as ANN ground-truth training data.

The current equal-share transverse-distribution route is explicitly **verification-only**. Production design and ANN ground truth require a validated analytical distribution method or verified grillage-derived effects/factors.

BS 5400 is retained as a legacy/comparison path and remains isolated from the Eurocode implementation.

## Remaining major work
1. Open generated `.mct` and `.std` files in installed MIDAS Civil/STAAD.Pro versions, resolve any version-specific text syntax, and capture independent benchmark results.
2. Build the full seven-girder/deck/diaphragm verification-grillage exporter after transverse stiffness assumptions are validated.
3. Independently verify transverse load distribution and benchmark longitudinal/continuous results against grillage or established structural software.
4. Add validated edge-girder tributary permanent loading and edge-girder traffic effects.
5. Complete Eurocode continuous-span service traffic deflection using justified traffic combinations and displacement-specific transverse/load-pattern treatment.
6. Develop cracked/composite effective-stiffness, creep/shrinkage and construction-stage treatment for continuous service analysis.
7. Complete continuous-region fatigue, torsion and detailing integration where applicable.
8. Complete the continuous Eurocode verification manifest and keep ANN export locked until the independent benchmark is passed.
9. Define the continuous-bridge ANN feature schema/topology and justified random-variable distributions/bounds before generating training data.
10. Train, validate and calibrate ANN surrogate models, then add reliability analysis and RBDO.
11. Build calculation reports, desktop GUI, project persistence and Windows installer.
